# Introduction

**First things first:** This is a RPG related project I'm developing to test my programming/coding skills. Nothing too fancy, just using it to have a proper goal (or problem) to work with.

First sessions tend to be not natural (even considering running a session 0). Most of the times it seems that character doesn't have a clear reason to stick together. To fix that (well, trying at least) this program aims to create a biding background between players to work their early relationships. This can also give the DM a few goals to the campaign..

## How it Works

This is an adaptation of Fiasco to D&D to create some connection between characters.

### Names

The first step is to inform the player (or Character) name and hit RETURN. Once all players are set, simply hit RETURN with nothing written.

### Group Relation

There are two types of group relations: 
* Circle: This means that all players are set into a circle. Each player is related to the players right next to them.

* Universal: This means that all players have a relation with each other.

### Result

The relations are divided in eight Groups (general information) and eight Subgroups (specific). Every relation is determined in a random way (simulating the rolling of a dice). The result is a matrix that shows the relation of each player.

## TODO
- [ ] Create an interface
- [ ] Let the user create custom groups / subgroups
- [ ] Let the user choose the standard or custom groups to "roll"
- [ ] Make this an App
- [ ] Friendlist and Playgroups
- [ ] Integration with other apps
